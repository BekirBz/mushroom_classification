# Mushroom Classification using Classical Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project applies **multiple classical machine learning models** to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on their attributes.  
It was developed as part of the *Graduate Machine Learning Assignment 2025* and includes:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Training multiple supervised and unsupervised models
- Performance evaluation with various metrics
- A simple **Flask web application** to demonstrate predictions interactively

## Dataset
- **Source:** Public mushroom dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)
- **Size:** 8124 rows, 22 categorical attributes
- **Target Variable:** `class` ‚Äî edible (`e`) or poisonous (`p`)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Missing values handled
  - All categorical variables encoded using One-Hot Encoding
  - Dataset normalized for models sensitive to feature scaling

| Decision Tree          | 1.000    | 1.000     | 1.000  | 1.000    |
| Logistic Regression    | 0.999    | 0.999     | 0.999  | 0.999    |
| SVM                    | 0.999    | 0.999     | 0.999  | 0.999    |
| KNN                    | 0.999    | 0.999     | 0.999  | 0.999    |
| Naive Bayes            | 0.948    | 0.948     | 0.948  | 0.948    |

Most models achieved near-perfect classification due to dataset characteristics.

## üåê Web Application
A **Flask** app (`app.py`) was built to demonstrate mushroom classification interactively.  
Users can input mushroom attributes and get an **"Edible"** or **"Poisonous"** prediction in real-time.
